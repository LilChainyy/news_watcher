## 📊 WHAT THE CODE DOES

### In Simple Terms

**Input:**
- Historical news events (dates, tickers, types)
- Historical price data (OHLCV)

**Process:**
1. Measure price changes after each event
2. Find patterns across different stocks
3. Validate patterns statistically
4. Calculate risk metrics

**Output:**
- Hidden correlations discovered
- Statistical confidence levels
- Risk/reward profiles
- Predictions for new events

### Real Example

**Discovery:**
```
When CoreWeave has infrastructure failures,
Nebius drops 3.2% (p=0.003, 99.7% confidence)
even though Nebius isn't mentioned in the news.
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Trade before others notice the pattern
- Hedge correlated positions proactively
- Find pairs trading opportunities
- Understand systemic risk

→ Try lower significance level temporarily

**"Too many correlations"**
→ Apply Bonferroni correction
→ Check sample sizes
→ Verify economic logic

**"Can't understand the code"**
→ Start with LEARNING_GUIDE.py
→ Run working_example.py first
→ Study one method at a time
